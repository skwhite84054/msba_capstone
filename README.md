# msba_capstone

This repository contains the final files for the University of Utah MSBA Capstone project.

The HTML file contains the group's final EDA and modeling presented to the sponsor on 4/13/23.  Please note: Due to the overwhelming computer intensity running XGBoost, the knitted document only is performed on a subset of the data.  If run on the complete dataset, the numbers will differ slightly. I have also included urban_zip.xlsx which contains the 2013 USDA population (source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes.aspx) that is merged with the Swire datasets.
